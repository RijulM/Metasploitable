#Vulnerability Assessment/Penetration Test

#192.168.1.136 identifies a Metasploitable 1.0 image
#Some vulnerabilities (i.e. outdated software) will be incomplete as there are too many to list in Metasploitable 1.0

Executive Summary

( Company) was contracted to provide (Client) with a penetration test and report its potential attack surface. 
(Company) conducted activities to simulate a malicious attacker on the network.   
The following report is a prioritized list of vulnerabilities discovered. The benefits of applying the 
suggested fixes is a stronger security posture given the current system state. As this is exclusively an 
internal test, we recommend testing for defense-in-depth or layered security from externally exposed 
surfaces as well.
